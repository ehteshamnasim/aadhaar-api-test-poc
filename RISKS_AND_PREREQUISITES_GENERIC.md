### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|

| Topic doesn't exist | High | Low | Auto-create topics or pre-create validation |
| Consumer lag | Medium | Medium | Monitor lag metrics, partition assignment |
| Message serialization errors | High | Medium | Schema validation, proper ser/de config |
| Partition rebalancing | Medium | Medium | Handle rebalance callbacks, commit offsets |
| Message ordering issues | Medium | Medium | Single partition for ordered messages |
| Duplicate messages | Low | High | Idempotent consumers, deduplication logic |
| Offset management issues | Medium | Low | Proper commit strategies, offset reset policy |

### Success Criteria
- Messages produced successfully to topics
- Consumers receive messages correctly
- Serialization/deserialization works for all formats
- Consumer group management functions properly
- Offset commits handled correctly
- No data loss or duplication in tests

## Common Testing Risks (All Protocols)

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Environment differences (local vs CI) | High | High | Docker containers, environment parity checks |
| Flaky tests (non-deterministic) | Medium | High | Retry mechanisms, proper test isolation |
| Test data management | Medium | High | Unique test data, cleanup fixtures |
| Insufficient test coverage | Medium | Medium | Coverage thresholds, gap analysis |
| Long execution times | Medium | Medium | Parallel execution, test prioritization |
| CI/CD pipeline failures | High | Medium | Proper error handling, retry logic |
| Dependency version conflicts | Medium | Low | Pin all dependencies, use lock files |

## AI-Powered Test Generation (Optional)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Ollama installed and running (`ollama serve`)
- [ ] LLM model downloaded (llama3:70b or llama3:8b)
- [ ] Ollama URL configured (default: localhost:11434)

## Pre-Execution Checklist

Before running automated tests:

**Services:**
- [ ] Target service (API/gRPC/Kafka) running and accessible
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Network connectivity verified

**Configuration:**
- [ ] Config files present and valid (API URLs, broker addresses, etc.)
- [ ] Authentication credentials available and valid
- [ ] Test data prepared
- [ ] Sufficient disk space (>10GB free)

**For AI Features:**
- [ ] Ollama server running (if using AI generation)
- [ ] Model downloaded and accessible
- [ ] Sufficient RAM available

---

## Protocol-Specific Quick Checks

### REST API
```bash
# Verify API accessibility
curl -X GET <api-url>/health

# Test authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" <api-url>/endpoint
```

### gRPC
```bash
# Test gRPC server connectivity
grpcurl -plaintext <host>:<port> list

# Check service methods
grpcurl -plaintext <host>:<port> list <service>
```

### Kafka
```bash
# List topics
kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server <broker>

# Test producer
echo "test" | kafka-console-producer.sh --topic <topic> --bootstrap-server <broker>

# Test consumer
kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic <topic> --from-beginning --bootstrap-server <broker>
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Failures
- Verify service is running and accessible
- Check firewall/network rules
- Validate URLs/addresses in config
- Test with curl/grpcurl/kafka CLI tools

### Authentication Errors
- Verify credentials are correct and not expired
- Check token format and headers
- Ensure proper permissions/scopes

### Test Execution Issues
```bash
# Run specific test with verbose output
pytest tests/test_file.py::test_name -v

# Check installed dependencies
pip list | grep <package-name>

# View detailed logs
tail -f logs/test.log
```

### Performance Issues
- Use parallel execution: `pytest -n auto`
- Skip slow tests: `pytest -m "not slow"`
- Profile test execution: `pytest --durations=10`
